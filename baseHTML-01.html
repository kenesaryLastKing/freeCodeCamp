<!-- Step 5
HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.

The main element is used to represent the main content of the body of an HTML document. Content inside the main element should be unique to the document and should not be repeated in other parts of the document.

<main>
  <h1>Most important content of the document</h1>
  <p>Some more important content...</p>
</main>
Identify the main section of this page by adding a <main> opening tag before the h1 element, and a </main> closing tag after the p element. -->

<!-- Solution -->
<main>
  <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
  <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
  <!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
  <p>See more cat photos in our gallery.</p>
</main>
