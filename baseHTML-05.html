<!-- Step 9
All img elements should have an alt attribute. The alt attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.

Here is an example of an img element with an alt attribute:

<img src="cat.jpg" alt="A cat">
Inside the img element, add an alt attribute with this text:

A cute orange cat lying on its back -->

<!-- Solution -->
<img
  src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg"
  alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back"
/>
